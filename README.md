The coding challenge requries the following:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Version 10 or higher
* A [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Client

## Setup

1. Fork the `frontend-developer-test` repository to your personal GitHub account.
1. Clone the `frontend-developer-test` repository from your personal GitHub account onto your development machine.
1. Open a Terminal window and `cd` into the root directory of the `frontend-developer-test` repository
1. Run `npm install` in the terminal

## The Challenge

Using React, create a To-Do application to manage a user's daily To-Do items. The application will allow the user to manage the todo items including create, update and delete.

1. Consideration into the initial state when there are no todo items, all items have been deleted, and all items have been completed

Not all requirements may have been provided, you may interpret some direction based on the above and ask additional questions wherever necessary.

## Tips

* It is not requirement to connect to an external API and persist data
* Exploring all of the code may provide you with useful hints
* Readable code over complexity is desired
* Keep it simple
* Input validation is not required
* Installation instructions will go a long way
